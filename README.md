### Course of the Data Science Masters 
#### http://www.ub.edu/datascience/master/
Here I uploaded the computational projects I have completed for this course. The contents of the projects are:

* Project 1:
  * Item-item based collaborative filtering recommender system. Implemented research article: http://files.grouplens.org/papers/www10_sarwar.pdf
  * Factorization based recommender system. Latent factor models. Implemented research article: https://www.cs.rochester.edu/twiki/pub/Main/HarpSeminar/Factorization_Meets_the_Neighborhood-_a_Multifaceted_Collaborative_Filtering_Model.pdf
  * Using Movie Lens data from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

* Project 2:
  * In-class Kaggle competition using Movie Ratings data set
  * Implement Personalized Google Page Rank algorithm
